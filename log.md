# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Typescript, in particular when it can be used with React

**Thoughts:** I feel quite comfortable with a standard use of TS but I'll need to work with the types used by React.

### Day 1: February 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I focused on the features of Typescript with React, then started to study MobX

**Thoughts:** I still don't feel 100% ok with Typescript in React and I am probably using just the basic stuff so far. That's not a priority, though. In the meanwhile I finally managed to tackle the state management "roadblock". I have approached Redux in the past but never built anything as it seemed quite complicated. I read few articles on Context API, Alfa, Apollo and MobX and decided to go with the last one: it's really beginner-friendly and I am really enjoying the course from its creator. Unfortunately it doesn't support hooks yet.
