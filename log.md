# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Typescript, in particular when it can be used with React

**Thoughts:** I feel quite comfortable with a standard use of TS but I'll need to work with the types used by React.

### Day 2: February 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I focused on the features of Typescript with React, then started to study MobX

**Thoughts:** I still don't feel 100% ok with Typescript in React and I am probably using just the basic stuff so far. That's not a priority, though. In the meanwhile I finally managed to tackle the state management "roadblock". I have approached Redux in the past but never built anything as it seemed quite complicated. I read few articles on Context API, Alfa, Apollo and MobX and decided to go with the last one: it's really beginner-friendly and I am really enjoying the course from its creator. Unfortunately it doesn't support hooks yet.

### Day 3: February 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I completed two final projects on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** That's probably too optimistic, but I'd like to complete all the certifications from FCC by the end of the year. I've finally completed the "Product Landing Page", which I postponed for months as I don't really like dealing with tons of CSS. The solution is good enough to pass the tests, but I should definitely work more with Flexbox. I also completed one of the frontend projects, using React and Bulma. Again: awful CSS but the app works fine.

### Day 4: February 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I continued with MobX

**Thoughts:** I completed the intro course by MobX creator, but I am not particularly satisfied. I spent most of the time configuring my environment, since the one provided was not working properly. I understood the concepts of the most important decorators but lost track on advanced topics. Now I moved to another course on MobX, which also features Typescript.

### Day 6: February 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I continued with MobX

**Thoughts:** I completed the second part of the course with MobX and TS.

### Day 5: February 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I worked with RESTful APIs with Node

**Thoughts:** I completed a course about building RESTful APIs with Node. It showed some useful tips to organize the project as well as the folder tree.
